# Influence People

# Principles 

## Don't critize; Don't complain; Don't condemn.
Put yourself in the other person's shoes.
People respond better to positive feedback than to negative feedback.

## Give honest and sincere appreciation.
Everyone wants to feel important and valued.
Be genuine in your praise and appreciation.
Don't flatter or be insincere.

## Arouse in the other person an eager want.
If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person's point of view 
and see things from that person's angle as well as from your own.
Make the other person feel that the idea is theirs.
